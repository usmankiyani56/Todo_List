Welcome to the To-Do List project repository! This repository contains a simple yet functional To-Do List application created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application allows users to add tasks, mark them as completed by checking them off, and delete tasks when they're no longer needed. It features a clean and intuitive user interface with vibrant colors and smooth animations. Explore the code to understand how the application works and feel free to customize it to suit your needs.
